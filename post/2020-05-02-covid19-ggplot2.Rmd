R has various ways to visualize data. In my opinion, ggplot2 is the most elegant, practical and somewhat easy to learn way to do so. It has a very common-sensical logic for creating graphs. It implements the grammar of graphics^[If you want to learn more about the theory behind the ggplot2 and layered grammar of graphics, I’d recommend reading “The Layered Grammar of Graphics”, http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf]. 

Following graphs about Covid19 are built with #ggplot2, using data provided by John Hopkins University^[https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19].

Data wrangling is done mostly using tidyverse^[Tidyverse is a set of R packages for data science. It includes ggplot2 as well as other packages to use in everyday data analyses, such as dplyr, tidyr, tibble and many others. Url: https://www.tidyverse.org/] package.

# 1. Loading Data and Checking Contents

Loading tidyverse, magrittr (For pipes) and lubridate (For date ops.):

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("magrittr")
library("lubridate")
```

Downloading confirmed cases data from JHU repo and loading into R:

```{r}
time_series_raw_confirmed <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv")
```

Checking out the dimensions:

```{r}
dim(time_series_raw_confirmed)
```


Checking out the first few rows and columns:

```{r}
as_tibble(time_series_raw_confirmed)
```

Dataframe has 264 rows (One row for each country/state) and 99 columns (One column for each day, starting on January 22).

# 2. Cleaning and Consolidating Data

Writing a function^[There is a more complete and comprehensive paper written by Zhao Yancheng, inspired by / used some of the code in the paper. Yanchang Zhao, COVID-19 Data Analysis with R – Worldwide. RDataMining.com, 2020. URL: http://www.rdatamining.com/docs/Coronavirus-data-analysis-world.pdf] to pivot the data into longer format and summarize by country (I might work on same data in the future or on deaths and recoveries, so, better to write a function):

```{r}
tidydatafunction <- function(data) {
  data %<>% select(everything(), -'Province.State', -'Lat', -'Long') %>% rename(country = Country.Region) # Removing unnecessary columns and renaming one
  data %<>% pivot_longer(-country, names_to = "date", values_to = "count") # Pivoting data into longer format
  data %<>% mutate(date = date %>% substr(2,8)%>% mdy()) # Removing the "x"s and converting to dates
  data %<>% group_by(country, date) %>% summarise(accumulated_cases = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% as.data.frame() # Group by country and summarise on case data
  return(data)
}
```

Cleaning previously loaded data into new tidy dataset:
```{r}
time_series_tidy_confirmed <- time_series_raw_confirmed %>% tidydatafunction()
```

Checking out new, tidy dataset:
```{r}
as_tibble(time_series_tidy_confirmed) %>%
  arrange(desc(accumulated_cases)) # Sorting desc. to see top numbers
```

Adding daily cases as calculated field from accumulated cases and saving as a new data frame:
```{r}
time_series_tidy_confirmed_with_daily <- time_series_tidy_confirmed %>%
  group_by(country) %>% # Group by country
  arrange(country, date) %>% # Sort asc. by country and then date
  mutate(daily_cases = c(0,diff(accumulated_cases))) # Calculate daily cases
time_series_tidy_confirmed_with_daily %>%
  arrange(desc(accumulated_cases)) # Sorting desc. to see top numbers
```

Filtering Turkey, calculating daily cases from accumulated cases and saving as a new data frame:
```{r}
turkey_time_series_tidy_confirmed_with_daily <- time_series_tidy_confirmed %>%
  filter(country == "Turkey") %>% # Filtering Turkey
  arrange(date) %>% # Sort asc. by date
  mutate(daily_cases = c(0,diff(accumulated_cases))) # Calculate daily cases
head(turkey_time_series_tidy_confirmed_with_daily %>%
  arrange(desc(accumulated_cases))) # Sorting desc. to see top numbers
```

Listing top 9 countries in terms of total cases (Will come in handy later)
```{r}
top_nine_countries <- time_series_tidy_confirmed_with_daily %>%
  filter(date == '2020-05-02') %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(total_case = sum(accumulated_cases, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  top_n(9, total_case) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_case)) %>%
  select(country)
top_nine_countries
```

#3. Plotting Some Graphs

Let's see how Turkey is doing, in terms of new cases.

Plotting daily case trend for Turkey, black line and dots respresent actual case numbers and blue line is regression line:
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = turkey_time_series_tidy_confirmed_with_daily, mapping = aes(x = date, y = daily_cases)) + # Passed on data, mapping and variables to plot, wrote explicitly on purpose
  geom_line() + # Added line
  geom_point() + # Added points
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + # Added regression line, locally fitted with loess method 
  labs(y = "Daily Cases", x = "Date", title = "Daily Covid19 Cases in Turkey")  # Axis labels and main title added
```

It seems that Turkey has reached the peak and now is on a downwards trend.

Let's see how top 9 countries (In terms of accumulated cases) are doing.

Plotting daily case trend for top 9 countries, black line and dots respresent actual case numbers and blue line is regression line:
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = filter(time_series_tidy_confirmed_with_daily, country == as_vector(top_nine_countries)), mapping = aes(x = date, y = daily_cases)) + # Passed on data, mapping and variables to plot, wrote explicitly on purpose
  geom_line() + # Added line
  geom_point() + # Added points
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + # Added regression line, locally fitted with loess method 
  labs(y = "Daily Cases", x = "Date", title = "Daily Covid19 Cases in Top 9 Countries") + # Axis labels and main title added
  facet_wrap(country~., nrow = 3, scales = "free") 
```

Another way to show the same trend:
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = filter(time_series_tidy_confirmed_with_daily, country == as_vector(top_nine_countries)), mapping = aes(x = date, y = daily_cases)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_grid(country~., scales = "free_y")
```

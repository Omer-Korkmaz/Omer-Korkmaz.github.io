#R has various ways to visualize data. In my opinion, #ggplot2 is the most elegant, practical and somewhat easy to learn way to do so. It has a very common-sensical logic for creating graphs. It implements the grammar of graphics [1]. 

Following graphs about Covid19 are built with #ggplot2, using data provided by John Hopkins University [2].

Data wrangling is done mostly using tidyverse package. Tidyverse is a set of R packages for data science. It includes packages to use in everyday data analyses, such as readr, dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, tibble, stringr, purr and many others with more specialised usage.

Loading tidyverse and kable:

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
library("kableExtra")
```

Downloading data from JHU repo and loading into R:

```{r}
time_series_raw_confirmed <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv")

time_series_raw_covid19_deaths <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv")

time_series_raw_recovered_global <-  read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv")
```

Checking out the dimensions:

```{r}
dim(time_series_raw_confirmed)
```

Checking out the first few rows:
```{r}
 time_series_raw_confirmed[1:10, 1:10] %>%
  kable('latex')
```

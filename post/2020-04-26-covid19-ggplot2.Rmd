R has various ways to visualize data. In my opinion, ggplot2 is the most elegant, practical and somewhat easy to learn way to do so. It has a very common-sensical logic for creating graphs. It implements the grammar of graphics^[1]. 

Following graphs about Covid19 are built with #ggplot2, using data provided by John Hopkins University^[2].

Data wrangling is done mostly using tidyverse^[3] package. Tidyverse is a set of R packages for data science. It includes ggplot2 as well as other packages to use in everyday data analyses, such as dplyr, tidyr, tibble and many others.

# 1. Loading Data and Checking Contents

Loading tidyverse, magrittr (For pipes) and lubridate (For date ops.):

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
library("magrittr")
library("lubridate")
```

Downloading confirmed cases data from JHU repo and loading into R:

```{r}
time_series_raw_confirmed <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv")
```

Checking out the dimensions:

```{r}
dim(time_series_raw_confirmed)
```


Checking out the first few rows and columns:

```{r}
as_tibble(time_series_raw_confirmed)
```

Dataframe has 264 rows (One row for each country/state) and 99 columns (One column for each day, starting on January 22).

# 2. Cleaning and Consolidating Data

Writing a function to pivot the data into longer format and summarize by country (I might work on same data in the future or on deaths and recoveries, so, better to write a function):

```{r}
tidydatafunction <- function(data) {
  data %<>% select(everything(), -'Province.State', -'Lat', -'Long') %>% rename(country = Country.Region) # Removing unnecessary columns
  data %<>% pivot_longer(-country, names_to = "date", values_to = "count") # Pivoting data into longer format
  data %<>% mutate(date = date %>% substr(2,8)%>% mdy()) # Removing the "x"s and converting to dates
  data %<>% group_by(country, date) %>% summarise(count = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% as.data.frame() # Summarise by country
  return(data)
}
```

Cleaning previously loaded data into new tidy dataset:
```{r}
time_series_tidy_confirmed <- time_series_raw_confirmed %>% tidydatafunction()
```

```{r}
as_tibble(time_series_tidy_confirmed) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
```

This is a draft post and will be updated.
